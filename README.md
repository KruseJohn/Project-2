# Hound Around Town
Hound Around Town is an application created to keep track of customers who own dogs and manage drivers who shuttle these pets to different locations. The application also allows new drivers to inquire to become an approved driver for the company.  

## Motivation
Many companies are moving to a remote workforce. With this comes the demand for teams to keep track of tasks and customers on a remote platform. This application in particular fills the need presented by Hounds Around Town,  but the application can be customized to fit any businesses unique model.
